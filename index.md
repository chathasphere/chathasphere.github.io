I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at University of Michigan, with an expected graduation date in summer 2025. I use emergent techniques in deep learning to enhance mechanistic, causal understanding of complex health problems. My research interests include Bayesian inference, deep learning, epidemiology, healthcare data, and stochastic simulation. I'm currently seeking a postdoc position in for next fall.
