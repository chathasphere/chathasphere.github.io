Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky,<br>
I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,<br>
"Awake my Little ones and fill the cup<br>
Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."<br>

### Who am I?

I am a second-year PhD Student in the Statistics Department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I research applications of deep learning (particularly the Transformer architecture) to electronic health records for early disease prediction. I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and causal inference.
