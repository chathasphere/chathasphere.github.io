title: The Communist Manifesto (Marx/Engels)
---

## Intro

The one everyone's heard of, a popular starting point for Marxist theory. *A specter is haunting bird app,* for we all know Marx would have been a poster, being a man of Letters prone to acerbic verbal duels. Understandable that he was so self-assured (yet exasperated), for he saw further ahead than any of his contemporaries. In 1847, capitalism was a young grove taking root largely in England, whereas today it's a world-entangling organism, a Matrix[^1] if you will.

Keep in mind that this is a **pamphlet** written to encourage the workers as they faced down the French and German despots in the incipient Revolution of 1848. Hence it portrays a simplified version of historical materialism. The Revolution of 1848 ended in reaction as the bourgeoisie realized they preferred "autocracy" and "illiberalism" with the old aristocracy to social equality with the masses. (This pattern has played out repeatedly since.) Long years of poverty and ill-health in exile corroded Marx's prophetic, millenarian optimism that the World Revolution would come in his lifetime. Compare the older Marx that wrote the dense economic treatise of *Capital* to the young polemicist. 

We look for the germ of his great ideas in the *Manifesto.* And besides, it's a highly-quotable banger of a read.

## Bourgeois and Proletarians

"history of all class struggle..."
reductive? unfalsifiable? 
when studying the evolution of society, look first to human relation to nature: productive activity, material culture. Not dismissing the contribution of the superstructure
the narrative, the arc (postmodern vogue to challenge the existence of a narrative--but this leads to passive helplessness in the face of entropic collapse)

1.
“common ruin of the contending classes”

“committee for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie”

“has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”.”

“All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.”

***
but no! we have a society of spectacle instead

being -> having -> appearing
***

“a world after its own image”

“a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells”
 
“The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.”

damn, racism

“The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association.”
optimistic

II
actual relations springing from an existing class struggle

But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products
(what about technofeudalism?)

Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality

“by “individual” you mean no other person than the bourgeois,”

“the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all” (ideology)

“The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property..”

“The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.”

“one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other”
religion, morality, justice, …?

dictatorship of the proletariat

socialism —> communism
althusser: coexistence of capitalist and communist modes of production under socialism

“an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.”


III
German theoretical abstraction
(Wagner/Heine)

critiques of the current “appeals to the working class”
today: liberalism, nationalism, progressivism

IV
The importance of Germany to the revolution
(note the eastward movement of revolutionary energy…
England -> France -> Germany -> Russia -> China

“the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.”
case for 2020 protests/abolition movement
In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.
(why is private property values above human life in america?)


### Notes from Class

Seeing society as a disunity, a system of conflict, against the idealist false universalisms (l'enfants de la patrie, nationalism, equals in a market (there is no society)). A mostly-veiled civil war in society. 

All "society"/"civilziation" requires a surplus (as opposed to hunter-gatherer bands). Some produce the surplus, others consume it.  History of the world so far is of exploitation. Thus far limited.

Invites us to imagine a history beyond...
(Kant: nothing beyond pure reason. Hegel: consciousness is a historical development. Limits can be overcome (negated, aufhebungled)). 

Marxism as a critique. But also a political project (we've lost this in most academic Marxism.)

Beyond a simple good guys vs. bad guys narrative (Jordan peterson totally misunderstood this). Against moralism

"Common ruin" it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. 

A sorceror that has lost control of the netherworld forces, the Demon. (An artificial intelligence run amok?)

Corrosive power of capitalism. All that is sacred is profaned. All that is solid melts into air. A totalizing Protestantism.

Emphasizing, the bourgeoisie have no real agency, either. Alienation cuts against them too: compete, or be crushed. (Living in fear of lost status...cf. lectures on liberation by Angela)

Capitalism rife with contradictions. Easy example: overproduction (because we produce for profit, not to meet human needs). Either constant expansion (imperial? financial?) or destruction of the surplus through hoarding, waste, war.

Capitalism sure as hell isn't an expression of a timeless human nature. Historically bound. Historical formation. Marx observed the formation of a new type of society: new "mode of production." Logical to ask what happens next. This isn't a stable system, though it's quite durable/adaptable.

Arrive at a theory of what happens next through rigorous scientific analysis. As opposed to the armchair utopian that imagines what the ideal society would look like. (If human civilization is to continue, it will have to arrive at communism.

Why the proletariat?

Proles vs slaves. Private property in general vs. ownership of slaves in particular.
(Perversely--more lucrative to offload the cost of reproducing a caste of workers onto the workers themselves. Force them to compete to live.)

The "revolutionary combination." Concentrate the means of production--levers of power. Create an army of educated, self-aware workers who realize society depends on their coordinated action. 
(Why doesn't self-consciousness happen?)
(Late capitalism finds ways to disperse & mystify workers)
Is the antagonism really simplified?

Part 2 addresses commonplace misconceptions
Laziness. Abolition of private property is this gist of it
Property is a relation btw capital & wage labor. Not just a thing.
Subjugation of labor to capital. A "social power."

[^1]: Climate change means that capitalism is a force of nature, a god as ancients would have understood it. Exemplified by the internet and its most fanciful realms (e.g. the Metaverse), it has permeated reality itself.
