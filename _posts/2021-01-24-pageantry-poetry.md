> The hill we climb\
If only we dare\
It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit,\
it's the past we step into\
and how we repair it\
We've seen a force that would shatter our nation\
rather than share it\
Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy\
And this effort very nearly succeeded\
But while democracy can be periodically delayed\
it can never be permanently defeated\
In this truth\
in this faith we trust\
For while we have our eyes on the future\
history has its eyes on us.

## Innoculation Day, 1/20/21

In an otherwise dull and dystopian ceremony, one display stood out by far. The [media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/gorman-performance-vital-poetry/2021/01/22/010c35dc-5c2e-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html) has [unanimously](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/opinions/amanda-gorman-affirmed-poetry-and-me-ashley-m-jones/index.html) sung the [praises](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/amanda-gorman-climate-biden/) of *The Hill We Climb*, delivered and penned by 22-year-old youth poet-laureate Amanda Gorman. Could this be one of those prized sermons that define an era? Perhaps, but it's nothing we haven't heard before. Maybe it's more about the spectacle itself than the written word. When our corporate news outlets and the bluechecked twitterati agree so vehemently on a matter of taste, it draws our attention to the imperatives of the Free Press. First, to entertain, and then, to mystify, and lastly, to generate revenue.

Lest I sound like a curmudgeon knocking a rising talent: poetry is difficult and Gorman did a fine job considering the material she had to work with. Her assignment was to paint the inauguration of Joe "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden (and the restoration of our globalist, complacent elites) as some heroic national achievement, a step forward on the arc of progress--an task of poetic license that would have challenged any grizzled bard, let alone a kid. So, not bad. At an age where most of us are floundering, Gorman is already a [style icon](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/amanda-gorman-new-kind-of-style-icon-fashion-purpose-sustainability-1234709979/) and plans on running for president herself one day.<sup id="a2">[1](#f2)</sup> I'm sure she has a long and successful career ahead of her.

## When Words Healed a Nation

Setting aside the author, the text is a dud. The poem eschews figurative language in favor of Clintonesque bromides ("America was always great, because America is good"). It might have been generated by the same AI that powers DNC teleprompters. If it succeeded in producing a effect, it's because [anything can sound profound](https://twitter.com/largemovement/status/1352018319600099328?s=20) when you *slam it.* As we might expect, two passages are directly lifted from Hamilton,<sup id="a1">[2](#f1)</sup>  the prime example of empty artifice that our self-deluding intelligentsia [touts](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/07/you-should-be-terrified-that-people-who-like-hamilton-run-our-country) as a National Treasure.

Americans of all political stripes are coddled babies, and now it is the turn for the Blue States to get reassured that everything is okay, that our unraveling national project is as good as new, that the shameful dissonance of the last four years is behind us. It's always darkest before dawn, and we the good guys have banished night! A young, Black woman (who represents the uplifting America we aspire toward) can say the magic words, and we've willed ourselves back to 2015 if not 2009. The TV is still on for now, but the channel has changed; it will be an anoydyne hum in the background while we sit down to brunch instead of a blaring sound and fury.

>With lullay, lullay, like a child,\
Thou sleepest too long, thou art beguiled.

## History Rhymes

Any politically-acceptable and nonsubversive poem will suck to some degree. It's the Poet Laureate's burden. A challenge of the poet (literally, "maker"<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> in Greek) is to forge an unpredictable, raw language that provokes the listener instead of plastic-wrapping their existing worldview. It should surprise nobody that Amanda is a graduate of Harvard, the world institution unequalled in schooling its students in how to speak in the vetted formulae of the bourgeois elite. Should we call it "speaking Power to Truth?" To see the value of an elite education, look no further than Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the McKinsey Powerpoint made flesh. He is the master of [parroting back platitudes](http://www.mayopete.io/) that flatter the shareholders but don't mean anything. Ironic that his father was a Gramsci scholar--a political speech is likely [hegemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony), but a poem shouldn't be.

Which reminds me: I recently enjoyed the poetry collection [*1919* by Eve Ewing](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1272-1919), a poet and sociologist who studies racism in the education system in Chicago's South Side. An [excerpt](https://anotherchicagomagazine.net/2019/06/11/4-poems-by-eve-ewing-and-an-interview-with-the-author/):
>o my ugly homestead,\
blood-sodden prairie.\
*urbs in horto*. meaning:\
if it grows, it once came from dirt\
o my love, why do you till the ground with iron?\
o my miracle, why do you fire in the dark?\
you, thief of dusk, you, captain of my sorrows. you, avarice.\
your ground is greedy for our children, and you take them as you please.

The Chicago Race Riots of 1919 are the thematic axis of Ewing's poems, and if you've read anything about them you would be reminded of last summer's nationwide uprisings against racism. After all the carnage and destruction (which, it is worth noting, white Chicagoans incited), a government commission acknowledged that racism existed and was systemic. Its recomendations were promptly ignored, and a hundred years (of noble, gradual, American progress) later we see the [same patterns play out](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/877108426/poet-eve-ewing-connects-1919-chicago-to-todays-racial-unrest).

During those turbulent summer days, I began reading the autobiography of "Black Bolshevik" [Harry Haywood](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/a.htm#haywood-harry), which begis with an account the 1919 Chicago Riot. For Haywood, the rebellion in Chicago against the oppressors was the decisive event that sent him down the path of a full-time revolutionary. Haywood, like fellow radical W.E.B. DuBois, decried systemic (i.e. enshrined in American political and economic bodies) racism decades before the idea became acceptable to the respectable white moderates. They recognized that, as long as market forces mandated competition between all workers and the maximal exploitation (through rent, low wages, and policing) of the most precarious, the social hierarchy of the races would be reproduced and even extended.

 The point I am making is not that "race" is some essential, diabolical presence that transcends history: a set of human relationships emerge from concrete conditions, meaning that under different conditions they could disappear.

 ## The Future Will Be the Same, but Worse

It is, of course, politically inopportune to rock the boat--American-style democracy and capitalism are the pinnacle achievements of human civilization, and you're either a class-reductionist or a daydreamer if you fuss too much about substantial reform. So we'll content ourselves with shifting around cultural symbols on the surface while a current pulls us onward. Soon enough we may have a Black-Desi woman prosecutor as head of state and we'll get an augmented Patriot Act to target the racists. As Uber and the other tech-bubble companies tell us, [precarious gig work for all](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/11/proposition-22-california-uber-lyft-gig-employee) is a victory for racial minorities. The noose will tighten, but the rope will finally reflect our nation's diversity and promise.

I will not begrudge anyone sighing a breath of relief as we put Trumpist insanity behind us (for the time being), yet it is far from certain that the new (or more properly, old) administration will lead us out of ruin. If not a step forward, an opening that might be forced. The boulders are strewn all about us; let us push uphill once more.

I suspect my scoffing at *Hamilton* is personal as well as ideological.[&#8617;](#a1)
