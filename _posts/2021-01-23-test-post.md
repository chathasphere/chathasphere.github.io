# Words

(…Wherefore, pious brethren, by confessing I lie, yoiks! I tell the truth, sort of topholy trumpeting-it, by the Pharisee G.V. Desani: see the feller’s tract All About …, publisher, the same publishing company): a language deliberately designed to mystify the majority, tempt ‘em to start guessing, and interpreting our real drift, and allegory, what the hell we mean: pursue our meaning on their sthula (gross), the sukshana (subtle) and para (supreme) planes, and levels, and still miss the issue and dash their heads against the crazy-paved rock of confusion.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

## Unicode Trickery

I can use [this](https://www.amp-what.com/unicode/search/bird) site to look up unicode symbols. And then I enter them in like so: &#128037;

# Math
I am following this [guide](https://lyk6756.github.io/2016/11/25/write_latex_equations.html).
$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$ P(X_1 \vert X_2) = \exp(- \frac{1}{2}x^2)$$

It follows that inline expression $$ \pi \approx 3 $$ holds.

The following is a math block:

$$ 5 + 5 $$
