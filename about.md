Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky,<br>
I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,<br>
"Awake my Little ones and fill the cup<br>
Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."<br>

### Who am I?

I am a first-year statistics PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests center on computational statistics in applied problems with a dependent (i.e. nonclassical) data structure, such as NLP, time series, and networks. This website is a collection of writing on my various interests, professional and otherwise.

For questions and comments, you can reach me at *pchatha [at] umich [dot] edu.*

### Who am I, really?

The English translation of all my names in their various languages is something like "Altar 'Kiddo' Farmer Lion Beehive." Call that my positionality.

I was born in New York City but grew up mostly in Baltimore, MD. I graduated with a BA/MA in mathematics from Wesleyan University in 2017, writing a [thesis](https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/object/ir-2470) on contemporary results in dynamical systems and metric number theory (a.k.a. Diophantine Approximation). I am an inveterate dilettante in the liberal arts tradition and continue to hold distracting interests in music and sundry letters.

### Disclaimer
Any political, philosophical, or metaphysical content in this blog is of **purely theoretical interest** and do not reflect the opinions of my employer (past, present, or future). In reverse of the old German saying, I'm seeking only to interpret the world, not to change it. 

### Miscellaneous
This website is built with Jekyll using the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. 

The site's title "Everything Flows" is from the Greek philosopher Heraclitus ("the obscure"), a pioneer of dialectical thought whose surviving work has a [remarkable correspondence](http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/mil.htm) to the teachings of his contemporary, Siddarta Gautama (a.k.a. Buddha). Both recognized that the only constant in life is change. Our doom (or gift?) as humans is to hold onto fixed concepts in a fleeting, empty reality. One such illusion is the continuous, unified "I". "Just as the river where I step is not the same, and is, so I am as I am not." ([source](https://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/mythology/heraclitus.html)) As Buddha would have it, the true Self is No-Self.

The poem I quoted is Victorian poet Edward Fitzgerald's free translation ("transmogrification" of a set of quatrains attributed to medieval Persian polymath Omar Khayyam. For more on the East Anglian millieu of Old Fitz, check out W.G. Sebald's *The Rings of Saturn.* For a story of the Persian Astronomer-Poet's fascinating life and Orientalist legacy, I recommend *Samarkand* by Amin Maalouf.

### A Postcolonial Virtual Land Acknowledgement

The .io domain name comes from the British Indian Ocean Territory, a remote set of islands. In the mid 20th century, the UK's government forcibly expelled the inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago in order for the USA to build a military base (one among hundreds). Because of its similarity to I/O (input-output) and the Italian *io*, the .io TLD became popular for tech blogs and personal sites. It is certain that Chagossians don't receive a dime for .io web traffic.

This history is a small illustration of [commodity fetishism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S4) in action. Even on the slick, virtual world of online, the goods we freedom-worshipping subjects enjoy have their origins in human interaction, much of which comes down to coercion and capture. "The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labor...vanishes" by the time said commodities are in your cart.
